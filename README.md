Election_Analysis

Project Synopsis
An employee for the Colorado Board of Elections gave me a project with multiple tasks to complete the election audit of a local congressional election.
1.	Calculate the total number of votes cast in the election.
2.	Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3.	Calculate the total number of votes cast for each candidate.
4.	Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5.	And finally, determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

Resources
•	Data Source for the entirety of the project was : election_results.csv
•	Software used: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.60.2

Summary of results
After compiling all of the results for the election it shows that:
	There was a total of 369,711 votes cast in the entirety of the election.
	The candidates were:
  o	Charles Casper Stockham
  o	Diana DeGette
  o	Raymon Anthony Doane
The candidates’ individual results were as follows:
  o	Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
  o	Dianna Degette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
  o	Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and11,606 number of votes.
With the results compiled, the winner of the election was:
  	Dianna Degette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

Challenge Overview
This challenge required me to take data provided and write a working code that sorted through it, and tallied up vote counts for each candidate. The most efficient way of doing that involved creating various lists and dictionaries within VScode to be able to reference them when writing different parts of the subroutine. Using said variables, I was able to make the program sort through the over 360 thousand votes and give me an accurate count and percentage of vote for each candidate in under one second. The hardest part of this challenge was trying to write the correct code to not only pull information from the data provided, but then also count and show the results in a clean and easily understandable format.

Challenge Summary
In summation, this challenge pushed me to think of different ways to pull information from the data to accurately count and come up with percentages of vote for each candidate. Overall, I would say the challenge was fun to work through, even with various parts of it being more difficult than others.
